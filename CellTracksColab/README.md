# PDAC CellTracksColab

The CellTracksColab notebooks have been adapted to analyze tracking data featured in the manuscript "Quantitative analysis of pancreatic cancer cell attachment to endothelial cells." This suite of notebooks is part of the CellTracksColab project, designed to facilitate comprehensive analyses of cell tracking data. The project's resources are accessible via the GitHub repository provided below.

The CellTracksColab project repository: [CellMigrationLab/CellTracksColab](https://github.com/CellMigrationLab/CellTracksColab).

## Overview of Notebooks

The CellTracksColab includes several Jupyter notebooks, each tailored to specific aspects of data analysis:


### Plot Notebook ✅


This notebook is specifically designed to facilitate the reproduction of plots featured in the paper, allowing for an in-depth examination of the tracking data. It is equipped with the following key features:

- **Direct Data Download from Zenodo:** The notebook enables users to seamlessly download the tracking data directly from Zenodo, ensuring easy access to the necessary datasets for analysis without the need for manual data handling.

- **Customizable Plotting Options:** Users are provided with the flexibility to select and replot various track metrics according to their interests. This feature allows for personalized exploration beyond the analysis presented in the paper, catering to specific investigative needs.

### General Notebook  ✅

This notebook was used for loading and compiling the tracking data. It also includes functionalities for calculating additional tracking metrics, such as the Forward Motion Index (FMI). The notebook is designed to offer a comprehensive overview of the dataset.

**Important Consideration:** Due to the substantial size of the dataset discussed in the paper, reanalysis using the free version of Google Colab may be constrained by memory and processing limitations. 


### Count Arrested Tracks Notebook  ✅

This notebook is designed to process dataframes generated by the General Notebook within the CellTracksColab framework. It focuses on analyzing cell tracking data by identifying and counting the number of tracks that exhibit arrest behavior at each time point throughout the observation period. Key functionalities of this notebook include:

- **Loading CellTracksColab Dataframes:** It starts by importing the comprehensive dataframes prepared by the General Notebook, ensuring a seamless transition from data compilation to detailed analysis.

- **Counting Arrested Tracks:** The notebook identifies tracks where cells have ceased to move, categorizing them as 'arrested'. This allows for a quantitative analysis of cell arrest dynamics over time.

- **Computing Attachment Rates:** Beyond counting arrested tracks, it calculates the rate of cell attachment over the observation period. This metric is crucial for understanding how PDAC cells interact with endothelial cells over time.

- **Generating Attachment Plots:** Visual representation of attachment rates and arrested cell counts are produced, offering intuitive insights into the temporal dynamics of cell behavior.

# PDAC CellTracksColab

The CellTracksColab notebooks have been adapted to analyze tracking data featured in the manuscript "Quantitative analysis of pancreatic cancer cell attachment to endothelial cells." This suite of notebooks is part of the CellTracksColab project, designed to facilitate comprehensive analyses of cell tracking data. The project's resources are accessible via the GitHub repository provided below.

The CellTracksColab project repository: [CellMigrationLab/CellTracksColab](https://github.com/CellMigrationLab/CellTracksColab).

## Overview of Notebooks

The CellTracksColab includes several Jupyter notebooks, each tailored to specific aspects of data analysis:

### General Notebook

This notebook serves as the primary tool for loading and compiling tracking data. It also includes functionalities for calculating additional tracking metrics, such as the Flow Motion Index (FMI). The notebook is designed to offer a comprehensive overview of the dataset and facilitate preliminary analyses.
